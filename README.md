**Simple RSA Tool**
This is a simple Python tool that implements the RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) encryption algorithm. It provides the following functionalities:

Key Generation: Generates public and private key pairs.
Encryption: Encrypts a message using a partner's public key.
Decryption: Decrypts a ciphertext using your private key.
Message Signing: Signs a message using your private key.
Message Verification: Verifies the integrity of a signed message using the signer's public key.

**Usage**
To use this tool, run the script and select the desired operation:

Generate Keys: Generates public and private key pairs.
Encryption: Encrypts a message using a partner's public key.
Decryption: Decrypts a ciphertext using your private key.
Sign a message: Signs a message using your private key.
Verify a message: Verifies the integrity of a signed message using the signer's public key.

**Requirements**
This tool requires the following libraries:
binascii
sympy
random
Ensure that these libraries are installed before running the tool.

Note: This tool is for educational purposes only and should not be used for sensitive data encryption without proper understanding and further hardening of the implementation.
